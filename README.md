## Task Description

I will build multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.
When the user will press start , he will be presented with the multi choice questions.
The user will have time to answer these questions . Incorrect answer will subtract time from the clock.
When the time reaches 0, the game will be over and the user will be presented with its total score.
The user will be able to save and see all its previous scores.

## Pseudo code description

- Click on a button to present multi-choice questions and the timer starts.

- if the answer is right , save the score and go to the next question.

- if the answer is wrong , reduce the timer and go to the next.

- if timer decrementing is equal to zero then no more questions.

- Result was shown and the user asked if he wanted to save the result.

- if the user wants to save the result - he needs to enter his initial.

- if the result is saved , the previous result can be viewed by pressing a button .
